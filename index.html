    <h2>ðŸ’¡ About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up watching my hardworking parents live with integrity, kindness, and purposeâ€”and those values have shaped everything I do. I learned early that if something feels big or intimidating, thatâ€™s usually a sign I should try it. That mindset is what led me to software development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I fell in love with IT in middle school and followed that path all the way through university. I started coding with C++ and Java, then kept learningâ€”HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, PHP, Kotlin. While studying at Bahir Dar University, I built two apps I'm proud of: a custom Amharic word processor (yes, with its own .doc format) and a mobile app for COVID awareness. After transferring to Metro State, I dove deeper into full-stack development. My favorite projects there include a meal planning app and a bullet train management system(which was for my capstone graduation course).
  </p>
  <p>
    What I love most about coding is that itâ€™s a creative skill. You can build something from nothingand if you build the right thing, it can really help people. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here: to keep growing, keep building, and make things that matter.
